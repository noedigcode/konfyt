Konfyt - Digital Keyboard Workstation for Linux
===============================================

2014-2017 Gideon van der Kolf, noedigcode@gmail.com

Welkom by Konfyt.
Konfyt is a digital keyboard workstation for Linux which allows you to set up
patches, each with multiple layers, and instantly switch between these patches
for live keyboard playing. Patches may consist of multiple layers of soundfonts
(.sf2), SFZs, audio input ports and MIDI output ports. Konfyt features a library
which scans the filesystem for and allows quick access to soundfont programs and
SFZs.

Konfyt is very much alpha software with no guarantee of support or maintenance
and may be unstable.

Konfyt is open source under the GPL license and makes use of Qt, JACK, Carla and
Fluidsynth. Note however that Linuxsampler is used to load SFZ files (via Carla)
which is licensed under GPL with a commercial exception.

Requirements:
=============

Konfyt was developed and tested on KXStudio 14.04.2.

Qt4
    Ensure that the Qt4 development packages are installed.

    Check the Qt version that qmake uses with:
    qmake -v

    Sometimes, if both Qt5 and Qt4 are installed, the Qt4 qmake command is:
    qmake-qt4

pkg-config

Fluidsynth 1.1.6
    (Version 1.1.5 has a nasty polyphony bug)
    Ensure the development files are installed (libfluidsynth-dev in Ubuntu).

Carla
    Available in the KXStudio repositories (http://kxstudio.linuxaudio.org/Repositories)
    All versions are not guaranteed to work since Carla is under active development
    and the API is still subject to change.
    Tested with:
     - 1.9.6 (2.0-beta4) (KXStudio package 1.9.5~git20161121)
     - 1.9.7 (2.0-beta5) (KXStudio Package 1.9.7+git20170105)

g++-4.8


Building:
=========

The .pro file can be opened with QtCreator and configured and built by following
the steps in the IDE.

To build from the command line, run the following:
qmake konfyt.pro
make

A "konfyt" executable will be produced.
