Changelog
=========

[1.2.2] - January 2023
----------------------

Added

- Update MIDI filter immediately while editing it in the GUI editor.

Fixes

- Fix library item double-click working intermittently on some systems.
- Destination audio port null check to prevent crash when JACK/system is not
  configured correctly. (When JACK can't allocate memory due to user not
  belonging to audio group or ulimits not being set up correctly. Note that
  in this case the audio system is not functioning correctly in any case.)

Changes

- About dialog is now integrated into the main window.
- MIDI filter editor size constraints and scrollability removed for hopefully
  better layout across different systems.


[1.2.1] - October 2022
----------------------

Added

- Checkbox in filesystem view to show hidden files.
- Add dropdown menu to filesystem view path text box with common paths and remove
  home and current project buttons.
- Warn when running an external app with a project directory replacement tag in
  the command if the project has not been saved yet.

Fixes

- Remove dot at end of project folder names when saved to default project location.
- Use the correct project directory when running an external app that was added
  before the project was saved.

Changes

- Insert new patches after currently selected patch when adding new or copying a
  patch.
- Show a menu when the remove patch button is clicked to serve as a confirmation.
- Print slightly less alarming message in console when MIDI map presets file or
  settings file does not exist.
- When running an app from the external app list, print the expanded name if it
  contains a $PROJ_DIR$ and print a message when an external app stops.


[1.2.0] - July 2022
-------------------

Added

- Patch list drag and drop for re-ordering patches.

- Pitchbend up and down ranges in MIDI filter.
- Add CC block-list to MIDI filter.
- Note velocity mapping with graph and presets in MIDI filter.
- Escape key returns to main patch view.
- Library context menu to remove patch from library.

- Add liblscp version to about text.

Fixes

- Apply patch list number/note show/hide setting when loading a project.
- Change volume when master volume slider is moved without using the mouse.
- Only relay noteoff messages to GUI (e.g. in console or received MIDI events lists)
  if it actually resulted in a noteoff message being sent.
- MIDI send list editor now only shows received MIDI events for the corresponding
  layer.

Changes

- When console/main window not available any more (e.g. during program exit),
  send print output to stdout.
- CC allow-list in MIDI filter is now space-separated text.
- Entire top toolbar area becomes red to emphasise when Panic is activated.
- Patches in library view don't show file extension any more.
- Some code housekeeping and refactoring.

Removed

[1.1.7] - January 2022
----------------------

Fixes

- Set QT_XCB_GL_INTEGRATION=none environment variable at startup to prevent
  event loop from stopping when screen is locked on some systems which caused
  some functionality like MIDI triggers and port reconnections to stop working.
- Fix .gig file loading.


[1.1.6] - October 2021
----------------------

Added

- Filesystem view now supports previewing of instruments like the library.
- Global transpose keyboard shortcuts added to live mode.

Fixes

- Pitchbend now works if Carla backend is used to play SFZ files.
- Fix SF2 loading from command-line arguments.
- Fix global volume up action getting stuck due to rounding errors.

Changes

- Some GUI tweaks in the patch layer view and library/filesystem preview.
- Misc code refactoring, cleanup and fixes.


[1.1.5] - July 2021
-------------------

Added

- Ignore global transpose option in layer MIDI filter
- Ignore global volume option for buses (checkbox on Ports and Buses screen)


[1.1.4] - April 2021
--------------------

Added

[1.1.3] - January 2021
----------------------

Added

- Per-layer audio output indicator

  are now cleaned up at startup
- MIDI output port layer output (right-hand side) button now has link to port connections
- Xrun messages show time since last xrun
- Patch layers can now be reordered

Removed

- Removed multi-project tabs. They were rarely (never?) used, buggy and
  resulted in unnecessary maintenance. Multiple app instances can be used
  instead.

Fixes

- Fix crash when loading sfz file if Linuxsampler is not installed
- Fix copying a patch pointing to original patch layers
- Fix always-active patch volume not changed by global volume when other patch is active

- Patch list behaviour and interaction improved
- Code cleanup and organisation, largely concerning the database

- Bank/program messages received now handled per port and channel
- MIDI filter screen last received messages only shown from associated port/layer

----------------------

Added

- Per-layer MIDI indicators (activity, sustain and pitchbend non-zero).
- Global sustain and pitchbend non-zero indicators.

Changed

- Fairly big code refactor under the hood, should not be noticeable to users.
- Fix bug of empty MIDI input ports added after removal of non-last port while
  console MIDI output is enabled.
- Small GUI tweaks.
