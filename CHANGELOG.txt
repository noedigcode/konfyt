Changelog
=========

Unreleased
----------

Changes

- MIDI port connection check boxes are now in their own "MIDI" column and the
  audio "L" and "R" columns have been renamed to "Left" and "Right".

Fixes

- Clear triggers when loading new project to prevent left-over triggers from
  the previously loaded project.


[1.6.0] - January 2024
----------------------

Added

- MIDI input port scripts.
- Show warning when SFZ engine fails to load.
- When saving a project that was not saved before, and that still has the default
  new project name, show an input box for the user to set the name before saving.
- After saving/save-as, rescan the projects directory to update the project open
  menu.

Changes

- Refactored warnings backend. Double-clicking on warnings now go to the
  corresponding GUI area. Warnings text update when port names are updated.

Fixes

- Script warnings related crash: when port warnings appeared after a script
  warning was active, crash would happen when script warning was removed.
- Fix script editor OK button not doing anything after a script warning was
  double-clicked while the script editor was already visible.
- Correct button tooltips in MIDI send list editor.


[1.5.0] - December 2023
-----------------------

Added

- MIDI scripting for patch layers.
- Other JACK connections can now also break a connection, keeping the ports
  disconnected.
- Create project backups when saving a project.
  Backups are created in a backup subdirectory in the project directory. Two
  backups are created - one before saving, and one after saving. This ensures
  data is backed up in the case the project is opened by a previous version of
  Konfyt that does not do backups and throws away data related to newer features.
- Live mode shortcut keys to change layer gains.
- Time for each console print message.
- Option in settings to open last project at startup.
- Save window maximized state when quitting and restore at startup.
- Command-line option to start minimized.
- Ask before saving project in a non-empty directory.
- Menu entry in filesystem context menu to copy path.
- Menu entries in external app editor to browse for file and directory.

Changes

- Disable GUI buttons when they are not applicable: external apps, Other JACK
  Connections page, Triggers page
- Improve layout of Ports and Buses, Triggers and Other JACK Connections pages.
  Widgets are more elegantly aligned now.
- Console popout dialog changed to window, allowing it to be maximized and treated
  like other normal windows.
- Increase external app editor width to maximum available space.
- Appearance: Colours of most GUI container elements and dialogs darker and
  consolidated. Dialog group box styles more modern and subdued. Layouts of
  widgets revised in several places.

Fixes

- Fix crash when exiting while an external app is still running.
- Handle pitchbend correctly for triggers, mapping it to 0-127.

Removed

- Statusbar


[1.4.0] - August 2023
---------------------

Added

- Patch MIDI filter (filters MIDI for entire patch before it is routed to layers).

Changes

- Add "..." to some GUI menu items.
- When a new port/bus is added, activate editing its name.
- When an external app is added or edited, focus the app name text box.
- Fix patch list menu button left border radius.

Fixes

- Eliminate potential threading race conditions related to MIDI filters.

  two layers.


[1.3.0] - April 2023
--------------------

Added

- External apps editor and autostart and auto-restart options per external app.

- Improve loading of all patches by simply loading patches in engine and not
  switching to each patch in order to trigger a load.
- Patch list is now resizable.

Fixes

- Add "exponential" back-off to LSCP (Linuxsampler) connection check timer to
  reduce GUI freezes when running Konfyt when the JACK server is not available.
- Improve internal ringbuffer class.

Removed

[1.2.2] - January 2023
----------------------

Added

- Update MIDI filter immediately while editing it in the GUI editor.

- Fix library item double-click working intermittently on some systems.
- Destination audio port null check to prevent crash when JACK/system is not
  configured correctly. (When JACK can't allocate memory due to user not
  belonging to audio group or ulimits not being set up correctly. Note that
  in this case the audio system is not functioning correctly in any case.)

Changes

- About dialog is now integrated into the main window.

  contains a $PROJ_DIR$ and print a message when an external app stops.

-------------------

Added
